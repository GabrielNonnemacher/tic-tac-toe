A simple game made with Angular, to improve my technical skills and further strengthen my portfolio.

<br/>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionalities

* **Start game**: clicking the button starts the game.
* **3x3 Board**: The game is played on a 3x3 board, offering nine possible positions for players to mark.
* **Two Players**: The game involves one player and the machine represented by the symbols "X" and "O".
* **Victory**: If the player manages to form a line of three of his symbols consecutively horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the player has won the match.
* **Draw**: If all nine positions on the board are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
* **Defeat**: If the machine manages to form a line of three of its consecutive symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the player has been defeated in the game.
* **Feedback Messages**: When the player wins, draws or loses, an informative message will be shown to the user.
* **Game Restart**: After completing the game, the player can restart a new game.
